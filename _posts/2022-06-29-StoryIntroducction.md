 *(Este es el prologo de una pequeña novela que estoy escribiendo inspirada por una partida de __Aventuras en la Marca del Este__ pasada por el filtro de __D&D 5ª Edición__, en la que jugamos el módulo que se encuentra en la caja verde, __La fiesta de disfraces__. Trata sobre lo que pasó después de la partida y me sirve como ejercicio de escritura. También, dentro de un tiempo, estos capitulos poseeran ilustraciones proporcinadas por mi pareja.

# The Massacre at Mecerreyes Manor
## Debrief for your Highness – Prologue
Your royal highness,

Last week, during the holy celebrations of Valion's end, tragedy struck the region of Greenmantle. Our forces apprehended their lord, Count Decimo Fabio Pictor, under the suspicion of him being related to the numerous disappearances in his realm.

There was a pattern to this mysterious kidnappings: a great ball held at Mecerreyes manor, to which a great deal of adventurers and sages were invited to it along with the nobles. These guests of honor were the talk of the town, but after the festivities were held, they vanished without trace, as if they had never been there. As Spymaster, I sent some of my men to investigate the manor beforehand, to make sure your highness' suspicions about the counts involvement were not just an ill coincidence. Fortunately, our doubts about the rumors turned out to have some truth to them. From the guests that attended the balls and masquerades, only the other noblemen had been seen leaving the count's state. This was proof enough to grant us an excuse to "visit'' dear count pictor without an appointment.

I am sure you remember what is what we found at the manor the day we deployed our royal guard in Greenmantle: terrified nobles, confused servants, most of the guards dead and a group of dressed up guests ready to land the killing blow to the Count, while his court wizard layed on the ground slain. These distinguished groups have been escorted to Marvalar for their interrogation, as your highness instructed. Our initial inspection of the manor has revealed to us an underground floor near the dungeons, a sort of trial ground, where we assume the guests of honor were tested. We have also found a great metal door, sealed by great magic and clever inventions. One of our royal mages and some of our engineers are working with the door as I write this letter. For now, we are done questioning the servants and the remaining guards. The servants knew little about this part of the manor. They only knew that the dungeons were off limits for them. They had noticed about the missing guests in their prior balls and they seem to be the cause of the rumors about the Count's parties. As for the remaining guards, they knew that some of the most veteran guardians counted with Pictor's trust, and so they were entrusted with some special duties during the balls, and that they were rewarded handsomely for it.

Right now, my men are interrogating the other nobles present at the party, and I will start to question the guests of honor soon. I'll send reports as more crucial information is revealed.

Always loyal,

  

Servius Swiftbane.
